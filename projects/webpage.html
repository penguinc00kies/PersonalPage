    <h1 class="left" id="heading">My Personal Webpage</h1>
    <h4 class="left" id="body">
        This webpage was created partially out of necessity and partially out of fun. I had seen enough job 
        applications asking for personal webpages, so I decided to give the HR people what they wanted. I 
        learned enough from my web development course in third year to feel confident in doing this. I also 
        wanted to give myself something to do over winter break. Normally I bake to pass the time, but this 
        alternate act of creative expression and creation scratched many itches.

    <h4 class="left" id="body">
        Thus I invite you visiter, to behold: my portfolio. A little piece of my soul to the world. Please enjoy.
    </h4>
    <h2 class="left" id="subheading">Design Ethos</h2>
    <h4 class="left" id="body">
        I strived to accomplish two things with this webpage:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Be an expression of myself as a person</li>
        <li>Act as a portfolio of my tech-related experiences</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="left" id="bodycont">
        It is intentional that the goal of self-expression comes first. I am someone who likes writing and 
        reading long passages of prose describing why things are the way they are. I love consuming design 
        documents (and I use that term liberally), whether it be the behind the scenes reel of a movie, to 
        how Canada's financial system is more insulated from bank failures than the US's. 
    </h4>
    <h4 class="left" id="body">
       So as you may have noticed, this webpage will be much more wordy than any of my peers'. That is how 
       I chose to put it together. But I still hope to have put all the important bits regarding my skills
       as a computer science student where they can be easily found, unincumbered by my exuberant wordiness.
    </h4>
    <h2 class="left" id="subheading">How It Came Together</h2>
    <h4 class="left" id="body">
        This webpage is comprised entirely of HTML and CSS. All pictures are mine, and the favicon was created 
        by me at <a href="https://www.favicon.cc/">https://www.favicon.cc/</a>.
    </h4>
    <h4 class="left" id="body">
        I actually spent a lot of time looking at webpages of my peers and professors to see how their webpages
        were laid out and organized. I eventualy settled on a clean, minimalist white theme. To add some
        personality though, I used a shot of the Toronto skyline as the navbar background. I think this is the
        most readable webpages I can achieve without it having the aesthetics of a blank coloring page.
    </h4>
    <h2 class="left" id="subheading">Why The Banana Tree Favicon?</h2>
    <h4 class="left" id="body">
        A tree was the object I had most confidence to draw recognizably in pixel art. The banana was literally
        a six-pixel afterthought to spice up the tree. I just think bananas are a very whimsical fruit.
